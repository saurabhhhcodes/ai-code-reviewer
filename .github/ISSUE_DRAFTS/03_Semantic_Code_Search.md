name: '🚀 [MAJOR] Feature: Semantic Code Search (Natural Language)'
about: 'Allow developers to search the codebase using natural language questions.'
labels: ['enhancement', 'gssoc26', 'ai-engine']

### 💡 The Feature

Instead of using standard `Ctrl + F` keyword search, developers should be able to ask RepoSage: _"Where is the payment processing logic?"_ or _"How does the authentication middleware work?"_ and instantly get the correct files and lines.

### 🛠️ Proposed Implementation

1. **Embeddings Pipeline:** Use a lightweight embedding model (e.g., from HuggingFace) to convert all code files into vector embeddings upon repository import.
2. **Vector DB Setup:** Store these embeddings in an open-source Vector Database (like ChromaDB or local FAISS).
3. **Query Engine:** When a user searches, convert their query to an embedding, perform a similarity search against the DB, and return the top matched files with context.

### 🏆 Why This Matters

For massive codebases, finding where logic lives is the hardest part of onboarding. Semantic search makes exploring code as easy as asking a question.
