name: '🚀 [MAJOR] Feature: Auto-Remediation (One-Click Fixes)'
about: 'Build the auto-remediation engine for the PR Review Bot.'

### 💡 The Feature

Instead of just pointing out bugs in the code, RepoSage should be able to **fix them automatically**.
We want to integrate the GitHub API's "Suggested Changes" feature into our AI Review Bot (`github-action/index.js`). When the Groq LLM identifies a bug, it should also return the exact corrected code snippet in a format that allows the PR author to click "Commit Suggestion" and fix it instantly.

### 🛠️ Proposed Implementation

1. **Prompt Engineering:** Update the Groq LLM prompt in the AI bot to accurately return the corrected code block.
2. **GitHub API Integration:** Format the bot's comment to use the standard markdown ````suggestion` syntax.
3. **Validation:** Ensure the line mapping works correctly so suggestions don't break the build.

### 🏆 Why This Matters

This is a killer feature that premium enterprise tools use. Building this will make RepoSage incredibly useful for developers.
